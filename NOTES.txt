<Add any important notes here>
Apparently we want to run the ROS bebop driver as a nodelet?

Drone Test Notes:
  Landing is more like falling out of the sky
  Probably need to increase intensity for movements
  Takes some time for commands to travel

  Seems like everything is working
  Failsafe works well
  Running it as a nodelet works well

Cooper TODO:
  Flesh out image_processor
  Flesh out swarm_controller
  Test all three together

Questions for Prof:
  Is there a better way to do the landing?
  It feels like some messages take a while to get to the drone
  Multi-threading in cv a good idea?
